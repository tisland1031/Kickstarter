# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

 The project involves comparing theater campaigns with their launch dates and fundraising goal. It entails creating two outcomes based on months for theater launch dates and dollar amount ranges for meeting goals for plays. The launch dates were based on theater outcomes while the fundraising goals chart focused on plays. 


### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to visualize a correlation between theater outcomes based on their launch dates and meeting fundraising goals for plays. The client would like to know the desirable month to run a successful play campaign while maximizing the best funding goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The below chart was created in the following way:
- The data was filtered to theater and added a column for “Year” and extracted the data from the “Date Created Conversion” column. Next, generated a pivot table to filter by category and year, provided a monthly outcome. The outcome of theater launch dates is based on three categories, successful, failed, and canceled.

- The pivot table suggested May had the highest rate of success based on launch dates while December had the lowest rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The second chart examines campaign funding goals with the success or failure of plays. 
The goal amount was broken into 5,000 increments ranging from less than 1,000 to 50,000 or more. Plays with a monetary goal of 1,000 or less was the most successful (76%) while the higher goal range of 45,000 and above had the lowest success rate (0% and 13%).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Experienced a few challenges while working with the Kickstarter dataset. Forgot to clear the filters while working in the Kickstarter sheet, this made my data skewed. During deliverable two, didn’t insert plays while working on my formula. Overall, need to move slower not to cause errors and try not to get interrupted while needing to focus.   

## Results

-  Outcomes based on Launch Date:

   1.	The theater reached their launch goal of 80% or higher during months of April - July. May has the highest successful launch dates. 

   2.	Launching a play during November, December and January is not advisable. The three months exhibits 54% and below rate of success. 


- Outcomes based on Goals:

   1.	If the goal is less than $1,000, fundraising goal is more attainable. Higher the goal amount, increase the failure of reaching fundraiser goals. 

- Limitations of dataset:

   The Kickstarter dataset has a few limitations. While creating deliverable one, didn’t filter subcategory for play but only parent category, theater. The parent category also    had musicals and spaces. The outcomes included all three categories. 

-  Possible tables and/or graphs that we could create:

   Creating a bar graph would be another possibility for this project. Regarding Outcomes based on Launch Date, I would add a subcategory, plays, to the pivot table.
