# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

 The project involves comparing theater campaigns with their launch dates and fundraising goal. It entails creating two outcomes based on months for theater launch dates and dollar amount ranges for meeting goals for plays. The launch dates were based on theater outcomes while the fundraising goals chart focused on plays. 


### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to visualize a correlation between theater outcomes based on their launch dates and meeting fundraising goals for plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Experienced a few challenges while working with the Kickstarter dataset. Forgot to clear the filters while working in the Kickstarter sheet, this made my data skewed. During deliverable two, didn’t insert plays while working on my formula. Overall, need to move slower not to cause errors and try not to get interrupted while needing to focus.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The theater reached their launch goal of 80% or higher during months of April - July. May has the highest successful launch dates. 

The theater had an overall low cancellation rate during launch dates for the theater. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

If the goal is less than $1,000, fundraising goal is more attainable. Higher the goal amount, increase the failure of reaching fundraiser goals. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The Kickstarter dataset has a few limitations. While creating deliverable one, didn’t filter subcategory for play but only parent category, theater. The parent category also had musicals and spaces. The outcomes included all three categories. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Creating a bar graph would be another possibility for this project. Regarding Outcomes based on Launch Date, I would add a subcategory, plays, to the pivot table.
